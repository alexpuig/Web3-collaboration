**Abstract**

Area of Interest: Polkadot Runtime Modules and corresponding DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers)

* We intend to add Self Sovereign Identity layer as a Polkadot runtime module following the ERC725 standard and W3C specifications for DIDs and Verifiable Credentials.
* We will require 2,5 months to complete this project.
* We intend to have 2 developers part-time.
* Total cost of $29,500.

The aim of this project is to turn Polkadot into an interconnected global Self Sovereign Id platform. Making these Ids valid and legal and build bridges between countries (p2p) for people and organisations

We will reach this by adding Self Sovereign Identity as a Polkadot runtime module following the ERC725 standard and the DIDs specification and using Verifiable Credentials.

Any application based on decentralised technologies needs an identity system to offer digital services and interact with the real world. Even more, they need a standard so all dapps can use the same Identity (it's interoperable) are users are protected by [criterias based on user ownership, empowerment and privacy-by-design](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html). 

Having this SSI Layer compatible with the substrate technology will open a world of unprecedented lighting possibilities to develop dApps using parachains. Also from a polkadot perspective, a Universal Resolver can also be included at the Runtime.
